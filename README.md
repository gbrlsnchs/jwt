# jwt (JSON Web Token for Go)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library is no longer maintained. I highly suggest migrating to its successor (built by
me still): https://codeberg.org/gbrlsnchs/jwt, a more modern and leaner version of this library
with support for generics, `encoding/json/v2` and clear API. See you on Codeberg!

Docs for this no longer maintained library: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gbrlsnchs/jwt/v3.
